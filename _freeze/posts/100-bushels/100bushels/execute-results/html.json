Here's a cool puzzle from that article, which according to Dudeney was first recorded by [Alcuin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin), Abbot of Canterbury (735-804). I assume it's from his manuscript [*Propositiones ad Acutendos Juvenes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositiones_ad_Acuendos_Juvenes) (Problems to Sharpen Youths).\n\n## The Puzzle\n\n100 bushes of corn are distributed to 100 people such that every man receives 3 bushels, every woman 2 bushels, and every child 1/2 a bushel. How many men, women, and children are there?\n\nThere are seven solutions; Dudeney gives one: 20 men, 0 women, and 80 children. Can you find the other six?\n\nLet's put the puzzle into algebra, so it's easier to discuss.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm + w + c &= 100 \\\\ \n3m + 2w + 0.5c &= 100 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolve for $m$, $w$, and $c$.\n\nThis problem (or one very close to it), is known as a system of [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation).\n\nHere's a picture to look at while you try to solve it. The answer is below. Don't peek!\n\n![The Mathematicians, Chirico (1917)](the-mathematicians-1917.jpg){fig-alt=\"The Mathematicians, Chirico (1917) source: WikiArt\"}\n\n## The Solution\n\nHere's my solution. I'll break it into steps. From the problem statement, we know $m$, $w$, and $c$ are all nonnegative integers.\n\n**1. $c$ is even.**\n\nThat there is an even number of children is obvious from the fact that the total number of bushels\nis integral, and that the number of men, women, and children all have to be integral.\n\n**2. $w$ is a multiple of 5.**\n\nTo prove this, we take the two original equations and eliminate $m$, by multiplying the first equation by $-3$ and\nadding the two together.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-3m &- 3w &- 3c &= -300 \\\\ \n3m &+ 2w &+ 0.5c &= 100 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthis gives us:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-w & -2.5c &= -200 \\\\\n w &+ 2.5c &= 200 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnother way to write the last equation is\n\n$$\nw + (5/2) c = 200\n$$\n\nSince $c$ is even, $(5/2) c$ is divisible by 5, and 200 is divisible by 5; therefore, $w$ is divisible by 5. **QED**\n\n**3. $w \\leq 30$**\n\nTo prove this, let's eliminate $c$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-0.5m &- 0.5w &-0.5c &= -50\\\\ \n   3m &+ 2w   &+ 0.5c &= 100 \n\\end{aligned}   \n$$\n\nthis results in:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n 2.5m &+ 1.5w &+ 0   &= 50 \\\\\n   5m &+   3w &+ 0   &= 100 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich gives us\n\n$$\nm = 20 - (3/5) w\n$$\n\nNow we apply the fact that $m \\geq 0$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n20 - (3/5) w &\\geq 0 \\\\\n(3/5) w &\\leq20 \\\\\n3 w  &\\leq100 \\\\\nw &\\leq 100/3 = 33.333...\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnd since we know that $w$ must be a multiple of 5, this gives us $w \\leq 30$. **QED**\n\nWhat are the multiples of 5 that are less than or equal to 30?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nw = seq(from=0, to=30, by=5)\nw\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThat's 7 values---exactly what we're looking for! So we're basically done, but we can fill in all the counts just to polish it off. I'll do that in R, but you can do it in any language, of course.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n# from Step 3\nm = 20 - (3 / 5) * w\n\n# from the fact that there are 100 people total\nc = 100 - (m + w)\n\npframe = data.frame(\n  men = m,\n  women = w,\n  children = c,\n  total_pop = m + w + c,\n  bushels = 3 * m + 2 * w + 0.5 * c\n)\n\nknitr::kable(pframe, caption = \"Allocations of men, women, and children\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Allocations of men, women, and children\n\n| men| women| children| total_pop| bushels|\n|---:|-----:|--------:|---------:|-------:|\n|  20|     0|       80|       100|     100|\n|  17|     5|       78|       100|     100|\n|  14|    10|       76|       100|     100|\n|  11|    15|       74|       100|     100|\n|   8|    20|       72|       100|     100|\n|   5|    25|       70|       100|     100|\n|   2|    30|       68|       100|     100|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it: the seven solutions to the \"100 bushels of corn\" problem.\n\n*[Nina Zumel](https://ninazumel.com/) is a data scientist based in San Francisco, with 20+ years of experience in machine learning, statistics, and analytics.
